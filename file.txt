Arrays:
    Easy: [
        try modify given array instead of a new array,
        add extra elements on the sides of array,
        majority element of array use inflection count,
        to find missing elements loop through first making negatives,
    ]

    Medium: [
        bucketSort,
        use pre/postfix products/sums var/array,
        sudoku use / 3 for i manipulation,
        to find consecutive sequences find leftmost in hashSet,
        palindromes use asscci and post/prefix hashes
        lexicographically string(int) comparison,
        reset array/dict/set
    ]

Two Pointers:
    Medium: [
        Replace instead of swap,
        Update pointers instead of using a Set
        Look for closed cycles they dont interact,
        try to inverse array multiple times,
        two pointer alternate,

Binary Search:
    Medium: [
        if midpoint w/o +/- 1, <= should be < else infinite loop,
        try to split into 2 logic then split more
    ]

LinkedList:
    Easy: [
        Cyclical search switch lists variable once nil reached
    ]

    Medium: [
        Reverse list on the way to the center if need to expand outward,
        try separating 1 loop into 2
    ]

BinaryTree:
    Easy: [
        Use while loops to go left deep,
    ]

    Medium: [
        For BST delete find the second largest/smallest child to replace,
        Use boundaries left and right dfs,
        Exit early with a count in dfs

BackTracking:
    [
        Pass in array being built up,
        Pass and ncrement index each iteration,
        Use pointers incrementation,
        Swap elements for premutations,
        sort array
