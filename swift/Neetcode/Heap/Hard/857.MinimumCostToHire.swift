// We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. 
// To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
// Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
// In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. 
// This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, 
// then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
// Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed 
// to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.
