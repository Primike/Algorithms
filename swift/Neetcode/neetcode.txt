    Medium: [
        bucketSort for k frequent numbers,

Two Pointers:
    Medium: [
        Update pointers instead of using a Set,
        subsequence vs subsets - may be multiple copies b/c of index,
        rotate array - there may be more than 1 independent cycle,
        for n-matrix rotations use reversing or reflection/transpose,
    ]

Sliding Window: 
    Medium: [
        Sometimes not necessary to decrease window,
        double the input and search window,

Binary Search ?:
    Easy: [
        Search for the largest not the smallest value,
        good for guessing numbers,
    ]

    Medium: [
        Use when answer has a numeric upper bound,
        if searching i < i + 1 use left < right,
        split rotated array in sections,
        careful with returning index vs first-k

Trees:
    Easy: [
        Space complexity for recursion is logn...n || h,
        Use while loops and current to go left deep on traversal,
        Keep a previous node for bst traversal comparison,
        Use two pointers on array to build tree,
    ]

    Medium: [
        For BST try binary search,
        For BST delete replace value with leftmost right,
        Use index for post/pre tree construction
        Run both flipped and unflipped,

Heap: 
    Medium: [
        Only have the heap hold the amount needed,
        Use a queue to hold temporary heap pops,
        When there is a best (k) to choose use a heap,
        When items need to be in queue use heap,
        Use 2 heaps,

BackTracking:
    [
        Be carful with for loops maybe cause duplicate branches,
        Best to use for loops in BackTracking if array available,
        Add to result as its array is being build,
        sort array to avoid duplicates and skip if previous ==,
        DP may not be possible even for same inputs if parents differ,
        during sort/build-array try minimize recursive calls,

Graphs:
    [
        Remember to check the entire island dont return instantly if not needed (&&), 
        If problem involves edges of grid try out to in instead,
        create a neightbors/edges array,
        topological sort, which order to take class,
        find all nodes a node can reach then compare
        bfs for shortest path,
        use an outside variable for dfs if tuple return,
        maybe pass in a parent node to avoid visited set,
